# Open decisions

Things the scaffold could not decide on its own, recorded so they get decided
deliberately rather than discovered in week 9. Close each with a line in the
weekly meeting and a PR that updates this file.

Open questions of a scientific kind live in
[execution_plan.md §10](../execution_plan.md#10-open-questions). This file is
for decisions that block or shape code.

## 1 · MUC2 and TFF3 are both targets and labels — OPEN

**Raised:** scaffold, 2026-08-15 · **Owner:** W1 + W2 · **Needed by:** week 3
(W1 builds labels in weeks 3–4)

MUC2 and TFF3 sit in **tier E** (targets) and in **labelling axis 2**
(opposite lineage: MUC2, TFF3, SPDEF, ITLN1). Invariant 2 says target genes
never appear in labels or the reference matrix. Read across the whole panel,
axis 2 loses half its markers and the "agreement across structurally different
axes" argument weakens considerably.

The scaffold takes the **narrow** reading, without deciding the question:
`build_signature()` excludes the target set *for the run in question*, not the
whole panel. Consequence as implemented — **a run testing MUC2 or TFF3 may not
use axis 2.** `tests/test_freeze.py` pins the collision set at exactly
`{MUC2, TFF3}` so a future panel or axis edit that adds a new one fails loudly.

Options:

| | Approach | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| a | Keep the narrow reading. MUC2/TFF3 results carry axes 1, 3 only. | Two tier-E genes get thinner axis coverage. Cheapest. |
| b | Drop MUC2 and TFF3 from tier E. | Panel edit — 2 approvals. Tier E is exploratory, so the loss is small. |
| c | Rebuild axis 2 on SPDEF, ITLN1 and non-panel goblet markers. | Axis edit — 2 approvals, and axes were frozen first on purpose. |

**Recommendation: (a) now, revisit at the gate.** It costs nothing today and
the gate will show whether axis 2 is carrying weight.

## 2 · Who owns the shared gene index — OPEN

**Raised:** scaffold, 2026-08-15 · **Owner:** W1 + W3 · **Needed by:** week 1

W1 emits S matrices on a fixed gene index; W3 emits bulk on the same index;
integration is a join. The plan does not say who *produces* the index, and both
need it in week 1. See [config/gene_index/README.md](../config/gene_index/README.md).

**Recommendation: W1 emits it in week 1** from the GSE178341 feature table,
committed as `config/gene_index/gene_index_1.0.0.txt`. W3 reindexes onto it
rather than the reverse — single-cell features are the more constrained set. If
W1's ingest slips, W3 emits a provisional index from the GDC gene model and W1
conforms. Decide in the week-1 meeting; do not let both build one.

## 3 · Symbol vs. Ensembl ID on the shared index — OPEN

**Raised:** scaffold, 2026-08-15 · **Owner:** W1 + W3 · **Needed by:** week 1

Follows from #2 and is the usual way a join silently loses 8% of genes. TCGA
STAR counts arrive as Ensembl IDs with versions; the panel and both labelling
axes are written as symbols; single-cell references are usually symbols.

**Recommendation: Ensembl IDs (unversioned) as the index, symbols as a mapped
column.** Panel and axis lookups resolve through the map, which is committed
alongside the index. Unmapped panel genes are a week-1 finding, not a week-9
surprise.

## 4 · COAD and READ: pool or stratify — OPEN

**Raised:** execution_plan.md §4 (W3 gotchas) · **Owner:** W3 · **Needed by:** week 3

Different treatment patterns. The plan says decide now and write down the
reason. It is here so the reason gets written somewhere findable.

## 5 · CODEOWNERS handles and branch protection — OPEN

**Raised:** scaffold, 2026-08-15 · **Owner:** W2 · **Needed by:** week 1

[`.github/CODEOWNERS`](../.github/CODEOWNERS) has placeholder handles, so
GitHub currently ignores most of it and the "two approvals for frozen code" rule
is convention rather than mechanism. Fill in the handles and turn on branch
protection for `main`.
